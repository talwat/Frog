Frog Datapack
===

## Update, two years later!

Alright, it's 2023 and I'm looking through my projects and I remember this one.

This was made **before** frogs were officially added to minecraft.
This datapack was last updated on September 29, 2021,
which is ~a year before they were officially implemented.

Nice.

## Info

The datapack has the same installation process as other datapacks. It is also recommended to have a decent computer.

This datapack **needs** [this](https://drive.google.com/u/2/uc?id=1MNQ5_yWqn-W_p7k1F0Z4nXmfV46QirRS&export=download) resource pack.

Note: Due to a recipe, cooking raw chicken is broken.

There are still bugs, so please be weary of that.
